    <h2>“use strict”</h2>
    <p>For a long time, JavaScript evolved without compatibility issues. New features were added to the language while
        old functionality didn’t change.</p>
    <p>That had the benefit of never breaking existing code. But the downside was that any mistake or an imperfect
        decision made by JavaScript’s creators got stuck in the language forever.</p>
    <p>This was the case until 2009 when ECMAScript 5 (ES5) appeared. It added new features to the language and modified
        some of the existing ones. To keep the old code working, most such modifications are off by default. You need to
        explicitly enable them with a special directive: "use strict".</p>
    <p>“use strict”</p>
    <p>The directive looks like a string: "use strict" or 'use strict'. When it is located at the top of a script, the
        whole script works the “modern” way.</p>
    <div id="disp"></div>

    <script>
        "use strict"
        let usernamelet = "usernamelet"//uncaught referenceError:username is not defined
        usernamelet = "usernamelet"//uncaught referenceError:username is not defined
        var usernameletvar = "usernameletvar"//uncaught referenaceError:username is not defined
        console.log(usernameletvar);
        const usernameletconst = "usernameletconst"//uncaught referenaceError:usernamem is not defined
        document.getElementById("disp").innerHTML = usernamelet
        username = "usernamelet"//uncaught referenceError:username is not defined
    </script>
